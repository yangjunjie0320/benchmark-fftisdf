WARN: ke_cutoff/mesh (100 / [33 67 67]) is not enough for FFTDF to get integral accuracy 1e-08.
Coulomb integral error is ~ 4.1 Eh.
Recommended ke_cutoff/mesh are 598.398 / [ 77 151 151].

Initial guess from minao.
Big error detected in the electron number of initial guess density matrix (Ne/cell = 127.986)!
  This can cause huge error in Fock matrix and lead to instability in SCF for low-dimensional systems.
  DM is normalized wrt the number of electrons 128
